**Describe the bug**
I have an issue/bug regarding your open wizard. I have used and adapted the wizard to your guide as best as possible. After loading the build onto Kodi 18.5 with the wizard I get a Box show that just says White with the options Retry Install or No Thanks. When clicking rety install it flashes a loading screen before stopping. Upon going back to the wizard it has removed my current build information allowing me not to perform updates. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
I expected it to load and then keep the build information.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Platform**
Amazon Fire Stick 4k 2019 Model with Kodi 18.5

**Additional context**
The link to my wizard files: https://github.com/AxPhantom/Scar
